       Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated
       with the ethno-linguistically diverse nation of India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 
            1947 and the Republic of India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures 
                whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonization, or influence, particularly
              in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, 
      architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the country.
